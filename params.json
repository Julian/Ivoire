{"body":"======\r\nIvoire\r\n======\r\n\r\n``ivoire`` is an `RSpec <http://rspec.info/>`_-like library for Python. If\r\nyou've never heard of RSpec, it's a Ruby library that is widely used, and has a\r\nslightly different twist on how tests should look.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Small Example\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n``ivoire`` has two modes of operation: standalone mode and transform mode. In\r\nstandalone mode, you simply write some tests using ``ivoire.describe`` and then\r\nexecute them with the included ``ivoire`` test runner.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you run the following spec, the test output will appear on\r\nstandard error.\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n    from ivoire import describe\r\n\r\n\r\n    class Calculator(object):\r\n        def add(self, x, y):\r\n            return x + y\r\n\r\n        def divide(self, x, y):\r\n            return x / y\r\n\r\n\r\n    with describe(Calculator) as it:\r\n        with it(\"adds two numbers\") as test:\r\n            calculator = Calculator()\r\n            test.assertEqual(calculator.add(2, 4), 6)\r\n\r\n        with it(\"divides two numbers\") as test:\r\n            calculator = Calculator()\r\n            test.assertEqual(calculator.divide(8, 4), 2)\r\n\r\n        with it(\"doesn't divide by zero\") as test:\r\n            calculator = Calculator()\r\n            with test.assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError):\r\n                calculator.divide(8, 0)\r\n\r\n        with it(\"multiplies two numbers\") as test:\r\n            calculator = Calculator()\r\n            test.assertEqual(calculator.multiply(2, 3), 6)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find this and other examples in the ``examples`` directory of the\r\nsource checkout, and run them with ``ivoire examples/calculator_spec.py`` after\r\nyou've installed ``ivoire``.\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning the Test Suite\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nYou can run ``Ivoire``'s test suite by running ``tox`` in the root of the\r\nrepository checkout, or by running ``YourFavoriteTestRunner ivoire``.\r\n\r\nYou need to have ``tox`` installed via your package manager or with\r\n``pip install tox`` for the former.\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\n``Ivoire`` is developed on `GitHub <http://github.com/Julian/Ivoire>`_.\r\n\r\nFeel free to fork and submit patches or feature requests, your contributions\r\nare most welcome!\r\n\r\nIf you'd like the best chance for them to be merged quickly try to include\r\ntests with your pull request, and adhere to general Python coding standards and\r\nyour own common sense :).\r\n","name":"Ivoire","tagline":"A simple RSpec-like wrapper and translator for writing tests in Python","google":"UA-34724411-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
